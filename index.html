			<!-- I saw your response to a comment I made on the last assignment. I know my "excuse" was 
			not acceptable, but I have been majorly burnt out this semester. Until very recently I was working full time every day from 8am-6pm on top
			of going to all my college classes, I had to drop CS 2400 because I couldn't keep up with it. I'm still suffering
			from the burnout, as much as I want to do these assignments correctly, I barely have it in me to dedicate the time and effort needed
			to make these pretty and perfect. I apologize for not being able to turn in something better, but I think I managed to hit most requirements for this?
			BTW, I heard you're teaching 2400 next semester, I think I'll sign up for your class if I can, I like your teaching.
